      <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        	<p>We are a Student Support Services program funded by the U.S. Department of Education. We serve students who are first-generation (students whose parents have not completed a bachelor's degree), students who are low-income, and students with disabilities. We provide the support you need to stay in school, finish your degree, and (if desired) pursue graduate study. TRIO is a selective program limited to 185 FSC students per year. We seek eligible students who are ready and willing to participate actively in our program.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why Join TRIO?</h3>
        	<p>Research shows that students who make strong, meaningful connections with faculty, staff, and other students early in their college careers tend to have higher rates of degree completion than those who do not. To support those connections, TRIO staff have created a two-week Summer Bridge Program to assist with the transition of being a high school senior to a college freshman. We understand the obstacles of being the first in the family to go to college while managing finances and working with disabilities. We use our experience and expertise to help you achieve at your highest potential while navigating the challenging terrain of college life.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<h3>Who Are We Looking For?</h3>
            <p>We seek first-generation, low-income, and/or students with disabilities who are serious about college success and can truly benefit from our program’s offerings. We want students who are willing to put in the hard work required to achieve their goals and grow as leaders to those following in their footsteps.</p>
